Vampire Editor
==============

This is a character generator for Vampires: Dark Ages.

Development
-----------

The editor is created with Netbeans. 
Especially some of the GUI parts are created with the help of the Netbeans GUI Builder. Please keep this in mind, if you want to change anything on the GUI.

This tool uses my MyXML library (https://github.com/Antafes/MyXML) for parsing and writing XML files.
